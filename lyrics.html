it's six o'clock on the dot and i'm halfway home<br>
i feel foul mouthed as i stand and wait for the underground<br>
and a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this<br>
i need something to remind me that there is something else<p>

you need a holiday somewhere in the sun<br>
with all the people who are waiting<br>
there never seems to be one<br>
say something, say something else<br>
say something, say something else<p>

advertisements are here for rapid persuasion<br>
if you stare too long you lose your appetite<br>
and a nervous disposition doesn't agree with this<br>
you need fast relief from aches and stomach pains<p>

put a new shirt on, wash my face in beer<br>
fall through the crowd, and disappear<br>
in the teenage magazines, the shopping malls<br>
walk through the wildlife for miles and miles<br>
hold my breath and count a hundred and ten<br>
and back up the hill to start again<br>
watching spiders on the bedroom ceiling<br>
they got big plans, so they're not breathing<br>
feel the frisson of tomorrow today<br>
i could get up but it won't go away<br>
do nothing to impress my friends<br>
just rub my eyes for hours on end<br>
oh england, my love, you lost me, made me look a fool<p>

i need someone to tell me everything'll be alright<br>
i need someone who'll hold me when the day turns to night<br>
i need someone who loves me more than you do<p>

oh we say that's not true<br>
and you and me in line as double bill<br>
surrogate heroes on tv and films<br>
i've never met anyone like you<br>
i've never done the things you like to do<br>
on the way to heaven in a comedy car<br>
the new stars of melancholia<br>
there's nothing to get angry about<br>
we're too hung over to be bash out<br>
oh england, my love, you've tattooed your past all over me<p>

i need someone to tell me everything'll be alright<br>
i need someone who'll hold me when the day turns to night<br>
i need someone who loves me more than you do<p>

oh we say that's not true<br>
and you and me in line as double bill<br>
surrogate heroes and welcome you will<br>
i've got a feeling that nobody's sold<br>
i've got a feeling I should let myself go-go-go<p>

and people will always miss all your life<br>
and people will always miss all your life<p>

Well you knew as much it's no surprise that today<br>
I'll get up early too from a lack of anything to do<br>

Because it's not worth the trouble of an argument<br>
And you have not really stayed in touch<br>
Well I knew as much it's no surprise that today<br>
I get up for round two with nothing to do<br>

To eat the crust on pizza<br>
Been taken out by her daughter<br>

Then there's sticky fingers<br>
And mother looses her knickers<p>

Days of enjoyment to which everyone cheers<br>

Sausages and chicken<br>

Drinking lots of lager<br>
Girls and boys are on the game<br>
All the high streets look the same<p>

Over the river they all go again<br>
Out into leafy nowhere<br>
Hope someone's waiting out there<br>
For them<br>
Cabbie has his mind on a fare to the sun<br>
He works nights but it's not much fun<br>
Picks up the London yo-yo's<br>
All on their own down Soho<br>
Take me home<br>
Other people wouldn't like to hear you<br>
If you said<br>
That these are the best days<br>
Of our lives<br>
Other people turn around and laugh at you<br>
If you said<br>

I know she'll leave me in the morning<br>
In hotel cells listening to dial tones<br>
Remote controls and cable moans<br>
In his drink he's talking<br>
Gets disconnected sleepwalking back home<br>
Other people wouldn't like to hear you<br>
If you said<br>

Other people turn around and laugh at you<br>
If you said<br>

Don't be so<br>
Eager to let me go<br>
Realise it could change you<br>
It could change your mind<br>
Try, try, try<br>
All things remain the same<br>
So why try again<p>

You know it is<br>

this is a low<p></font>
<font face="lucida sans" size="2">
And into the sea goes pretty england and me<br>
Around the bay of biscay and back for tea<br>
Hit traffic on the dogger bank<br>
Up the thames to find a taxi rank<br>
Sail on by with the tide and go asleep<br>
And the radio says<p>
(chorus)<br>
This is a low<br>
But it won't hurt you<br>
When you are alone it will be there with you<br>
Finding ways to stay solo<p>
On the tyne forth and cramity<br>
There's a low in the high forties<br>
And saturday's locked away on the pier<br>
Not fast enough dear<br>
On the malin head, blackpool looks blue and red<br>
And the queen, she's gone round the bend<br>
Jumped off land's end<p>

All these dirty words<br>
They make us look so dumb<br>
Been drinking far too much<br>
And neither of us mean what we say<p>
(chorus)<br>
Well you and I<br>
Collapsed in love<br>
And it looks like we might have made it, yes it looks like we've made it to the end<p>
What happened to us<br>
Soon it will be gone forever<br>
Infatuated only with ourselves<br>
And neither of us can think straight anymore<p>
(chorus x 2)<p>

(Tracy Jacks) works in civil service<br>
(Tracy Jacks) it's steady employment<br>
(Tracy Jacks) it's a golfing fanatic<br>
(Tracy Jacks) but his put is erratic<br>
(Tracy Jacks) saw a harley street doctor<br>
(Tracy Jacks) who prescribed healthy living<br>
(Tracy Jacks) but he's getting past forty<br>
(Tracy Jacks) and all the seams are splitting<p>
Everyday he got closer<br>
He knew in his heart he was over<br>
I'd love to stay here and be normal<br>
But it's just so overrated<p>
(Tracy Jacks) left home without warning<br>
(Tracy Jacks) at five in the morning<br>
(Tracy Jacks) got on the first train to walton<br>
(Tracy Jacks) and stood on the seafront<br>
(Tracy Jacks) threw his clothes in the water<br>
(Tracy Jacks) and ran around naked<br>
(Tracy Jacks) got stopped by the police<br>
(Tracy Jacks) and escorted back home<p>
Everyday he got closer<br>
He knew in his heart he was over<br>
I'd love to stay here and be normal<br>
But then it's just so overrated<br>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<p>
And then it happened on a tuesday morning<br>
Tracy Jacks bulldozed down the house he lived in<br>
Saying it's just so overrated<p>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<br>
Tracy Jacks<p>
Everyday he got closer<br>
He knew in his heart he was over<br>
I'd love to stay here and be normal<br>
But it was always overrated<p>

Local and direct<br>
Room to room an operator<br>
No calls today they'll just have to wait dear<br>
I call and I collect<br>
So just strike him softly away from the body<p>
You're made up too shiny today (in so much trouble)<br>
Thoughts are just pissing away (in so much trouble)<p>
I am a manager<br>
I am in control<br>
As the local delegator<br>
No calls today dear they'll just have to wait dear<br>
I offer no guarantee at all<br>
So don't take it lightly you'll put yourself under<p>
You're made up too shiny today (in so much trouble)<br>
Thoughts are just pissing away (in so much trouble)<br>
A new type face and new day (in so much trouble)<br>
You can't remember ten minutes ago (in so much trouble)<br>
It's too much trouble<br>
La la la la la<br>

wear me down<p></font>
<font face="lucida sans" size="2">
Every time I come here<br>
I'm not sure what to say<br>
I know it should be easy<br>
But it never seems that way<br>
You, you make me feel<br>
Like no one ever will<br>
So why, why do you bore me<br>
Until my heart is still<br>
You<br>
You wear me down<br>
My defenses are gone now<br>
And I can't fight<br>
I can't say I love you easily<br>
But you wouldn't want me to<br>
So I'd rather just say nothing<br>
And leave it up to you<br>
Then it's easy to forget<br>
You're iust as small as me<br>
Then it's easy to forget<br>
You're just as foolish as me<br>
You<br>
You wear me down<br>
My defenses are gone now<br>
And I can't fight<p>
